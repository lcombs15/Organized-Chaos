# Organized-Chaos (Group 7)
"Organized Chaos" was our group's name of choice in CSC-415!

## About the App
The app is generically called "Student Organizer", although, this could change. This project was created over the course of a 16 week semester.

The purpose of the app is to help college students get organized! (And for a grade in CSC415!)
* Keep track of due dates
